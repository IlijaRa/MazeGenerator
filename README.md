# MazeGenerator

MazeGenerator is far from finished but it already possess some convenient algorithms for maze generation.
Beside that, I am planning to finish all steps given in a book(mentioned in Literature And References section) and implement other features such as Masking, Braiding and Weaving, adding third dimension etc.
Project is implemented in p5 JavaScript library.
